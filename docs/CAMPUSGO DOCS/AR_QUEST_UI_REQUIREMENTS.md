# AR / Quest Play — UI Requirements (from API docs)

**Copy this into your mobile/AR codebase** as a checklist for what to show at each step. All data comes from **GET /api/quests/resolve**, **POST /api/quests/join**, **GET /api/participants/{id}/play**, **POST .../submit** (response), and **GET .../status** (polling).

**Joining is done in AR by scanning the first-stage QR — there is no separate “Join” button.** The app uses AR for both join and play.

---

## 0. Joining via AR — scan first-stage QR

There is **no join button**; the user **joins by scanning the first-stage QR** in AR.

| Step | Action | API | What to show in AR |
|------|--------|-----|--------------------|
| 1 | User opens AR and scans a QR | — | Camera / scanner overlay. |
| 2 | App sends scanned URL to backend | **GET /api/quests/resolve?qr={scanned_url}** | — |
| 3 | Resolve returns quest + stage + flags | Response: `quest_id`, `quest_title`, `stage_id`, `stage_number`, `can_join`, `can_play`, `reason?`, `location_hint`, etc. | — |
| 4a | **First stage (stage_number === 1) and `can_join === true`** | **POST /api/quests/join** with `quest_id` (and optional `stage_id`) | On success: AR feedback “Quest taken” / “You joined!” and quest title (from resolve or join response). Then load play (step 5) or show first location hint + “Scan to complete” / questions. |
| 4b | First stage but `can_join === false` | — | Show `reason` in AR (e.g. “Quest full”, “Already joined”, “You must be enrolled first”). Do not call join. |
| 4c | **Not first stage, or `can_play === true`** (already in quest) | Use **GET /api/participants/{id}/play** (participant from participating list or context) | Show play UI for current stage (§2). |

**Resolve response fields (for join flow):** `quest_id`, `quest_title`, `stage_id`, `stage_number`, `location_hint`, `can_join`, `can_play`, `reason` (when join/play not allowed), `question_type`, `is_elimination`, `stage_deadline`, `stage_start`.

**Join response:** `participant_id` (use for all later play/submit/status calls), `quest.title`, `stage.location_hint`. After join, show AR “Quest taken” and then either show the first stage’s location hint + scan/question UI, or call **GET /api/participants/{participant_id}/play** to get full play state.

---

## 1. Quest title

- **Source:** Not in the play response. Use **quest title** from:
  - **GET /api/quests/resolve** (`quest_title`) when scanning (join or play), or
  - **POST /api/quests/join** response (`quest.title`) right after joining via first QR, or
  - **GET /api/quests/participating** (field `quest_title`) when resuming an existing participation.
- **Show:** In the header/title of the Play screen and on result screens.

---

## 2. Play screen (current stage — before submit)

**Data from:** `GET /api/participants/{participant}/play`

| What to show | API field(s) | Notes |
|--------------|--------------|--------|
| **Quest title** | *(see §1)* | From participating/resolve/join. |
| **Current stage** | `current_stage`, `total_stages` | e.g. "Stage 1 of 3". |
| **Location hint** | `stage.location_hint` | Only when `stage_locked === false`. |
| **Questions (MCQ)** | `stage.questions[]` | Each: `question_text`, `choices[]` (`id`, `choice_text`). Use `already_answered` to show progress. No `is_correct` in choices. |
| **QR instruction** | — | When `question_type === 'qr_scan'`: show "Scan QR to complete" (no question list). |
| **Passing score** | `stage.passing_score` | For non-elimination MCQ; e.g. "Need X correct to pass." |
| **Quit** | `can_quit`, `quit_guard_reason` | Show Quit button when `can_quit === true`; if false, show `quit_guard_reason` (e.g. "Quitting would leave the quest below the minimum participants."). |

**When `stage_locked === true`** (stage not yet open):

| What to show | API field(s) |
|--------------|--------------|
| Message | "Next stage opens at {date}" |
| Date | `next_stage_opens_at` |
| Stage number | `next_stage_number` |

Do **not** show questions or location until the stage is unlocked.

---

## 3. After submit — outcome and score

**Data from:** `POST /api/participants/{participant}/submit` response (same shape as play + outcome fields).

| What to show | API field(s) | When |
|--------------|--------------|------|
| **Score (MCQ)** | `correct_count`, `total_count` | When present (e.g. "You got 3/5 correct."). |
| **Result message** | `message` | Always; human-readable (e.g. "Stage passed! 3/5 correct. Moving to stage 2."). |
| **Eliminated** | `failed === true` or `outcome === 'eliminated'` | Show "You were eliminated." (and optional `message`). |
| **Advanced** | `passed === true` and `outcome === 'advanced'` | Proceed to next stage (see §4). |
| **Winner (last stage)** | `outcome === 'completed'` or status `winner` | Show quest result screen (see §5). |
| **Waiting for ranking** | `awaiting_ranking === true` | Show "Waiting for results…" and poll status (§6). |

---

## 4. Proceed to next stage — next location or open time

**Data from:** Same submit response or **GET .../play** after advancing.

| What to show | API field(s) | Condition |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Next location hint** | `next_stage_location_hint` | When the **next** stage is already unlocked (no `stage_start` or it’s in the past). Show e.g. "Go to: {next_stage_location_hint}". |
| **Stage opens at** | `next_stage_starts_at` | When the next stage is **locked** by `stage_start`. Show e.g. "Stage 2 will open at {next_stage_starts_at}." |
| **Next stage number** | `next_stage_number` | For context (e.g. "Stage 2 will open at …"). |

- If `next_stage_location_hint` is present and `next_stage_starts_at` is null/empty → stage is unlocked, show location.
- If `next_stage_starts_at` is present → stage is locked, show "Stage will be open at {next_stage_starts_at}".

---

## 5. Quest result screen (winner / completed)

**When:** `status === 'completed'` or `'winner'`, or submit response `outcome === 'completed'`.

**Data from:** Play response or submit response: **`rewards`** object (null when eliminated).

| What to show | API field | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| **Points earned** | `rewards.points_earned` | e.g. "+50 points". |
| **Custom prize** | `rewards.custom_prize` | Show only if present (non-null, non-empty). |
| **Level up** | `rewards.level_up` | If true, show e.g. "Level up! {previous_level} → {new_level}" using `rewards.previous_level`, `rewards.new_level`. |
| **Achievements unlocked** | `rewards.achievements[]` | Array of `{ id, name, description, image_url }` for achievements earned by completing this quest. Show each (name, description, image if available). |

If `rewards` is null (e.g. eliminated), do not show this block.

---

## 6. Eliminated

**When:** `failed === true` or `outcome === 'eliminated'` or `status === 'eliminated'`.

| What to show |
|--------------|
| Message: **"You were eliminated."** |
| Optional: `message` from API (e.g. "Eliminated! You got 2/5 correct."). |
| Do not show rewards (points, prize, achievements). |

---

## 7. Waiting for ranking (elimination stage)

**When:** Submit returns `awaiting_ranking === true` (elimination quest, stage submitted).

| What to show | API / action |
|--------------|----------------|
| Message | "Waiting for results…" (or use `message` from play, e.g. "Waiting for results. You will advance or be eliminated based on your score."). |
| **Poll** | **GET /api/participants/{participant}/status** every 5–10 seconds. |
| **Stop polling** when | `awaiting_ranking === false`. Then: |
| If `outcome === 'advanced'` or `status === 'active'` | Call **GET .../play** and show next stage (location hint or "stage opens at …"). |
| If `outcome === 'eliminated'` | Show eliminated screen (§6). |
| If `outcome === 'completed'` | Show quest result screen (§5); play response has `rewards`. |

---

## 8. Summary checklist

| Area | Needed on AR |
|------|-------------------------------|
| **Join (AR only)** | No join button. User scans first-stage QR → resolve → if `can_join` call join → show "Quest taken" + quest title, then play. If `can_join === false` show `reason`. |
| **Header** | Quest title (from resolve/join or participating). |
| **Play** | Location hint, questions (MCQ) or "Scan QR to complete", passing score (MCQ), Quit (if `can_quit`). |
| **Stage locked** | "Next stage opens at {next_stage_opens_at}" (and `next_stage_number`). |
| **After submit** | Score (`correct_count`/`total_count`), result message, and one of: eliminated / advanced / completed / awaiting ranking. |
| **Advanced** | Next location hint if unlocked, or "Stage will open at {next_stage_starts_at}" if locked. |
| **Winner** | Points earned, custom prize (if any), level up (if any), achievements unlocked (if any). |
| **Eliminated** | "You were eliminated." (and optional API message). |
| **Awaiting ranking** | "Waiting for results…" + poll status until done, then show advanced / eliminated / completed. |

---

## 9. API quick reference

| Endpoint | Use |
|----------|-----|
| **GET /api/quests/resolve?qr={url}** | After scanning any QR: get `quest_id`, `quest_title`, `stage_id`, `stage_number`, `can_join`, `can_play`, `reason`, `location_hint`. Used for both join (first QR) and play (later stages). |
| **POST /api/quests/join** | Join quest (body: `quest_id`, optional `stage_id`). Call **only** when user scanned first-stage QR and resolve returned `can_join === true`. Returns `participant_id`, quest title, stage. |
| **GET /api/participants/{id}/play** | Full play state: stage, questions, location, locked state, next location/open time, rewards when completed. |
| **POST /api/participants/{id}/submit** | Submit answers (MCQ) or `stage_completed: true` (QR). Response = play shape + `outcome`, `message`, `passed`, `failed`, `awaiting_ranking`, `correct_count`, `total_count`, `rewards`. |
| **GET /api/participants/{id}/status** | Lightweight poll: `status`, `awaiting_ranking`, `outcome` (`advanced` \| `completed` \| `eliminated`). |
| **GET /api/quests/participating** | List of participations with `quest_title`, `participant_id`, preview (next location or opens at). |

All endpoints require **Authorization: Bearer {token}**.

## 10. Capstone panel — Why use AR? (It’s just a quiz / treasure hunt)

**If the panel asks:** *“Why use AR for this? It seems like it’s just a quiz or a treasure hunt.”*

You can answer along these lines:

1. **It’s not only a quiz — it’s place-based.**  
   The activity is tied to **real campus locations** (QR at the library, at the gym, etc.). AR is the interface that **anchors the digital experience to the physical place**: the user is at the spot, points the camera at the QR, and gets feedback (“Quest taken”, “Stage complete”, “Next location”, level up, achievements) **overlaid on the real world**. Without AR, it would be “open app → tap join → answer questions” with no strong link to where they are. With AR, the **campus becomes the game board** and the experience is location-aware.

2. **AR bridges physical and digital.**  
   CampusGo combines **physical exploration** (going to stages, finding QR codes) with **digital rewards** (points, levels, achievements). AR is what connects those two: the user sees the outcome (e.g. “You joined!”, “Level up!”) in the same view as the real location. That makes the experience more memorable and different from a plain in-app quiz or a generic “money hunt” that doesn’t use the camera or the environment.

3. **Differentiation and engagement.**  
   A “quiz app” or “treasure hunt” done only with buttons and lists is something the panel has seen before. Using **AR for join and play** (scan to join, AR feedback for results and next location) shows that the capstone applies a **modern, relevant technology** (AR on mobile) to a **real context** (campus engagement). It also increases engagement: users have to go to the place and use the camera, which supports the goal of getting students to move around campus and interact with locations.

4. **Clear technical and design role for AR.**  
   AR is used in concrete ways: (a) **joining** by scanning the first-stage QR (no separate join button), (b) **feedback** at the QR (e.g. “Quest taken”, “Stage complete”, “Next stage opens at …”), (c) **rewards** (level up, achievements) anchored to the scan, and (d) **next location** (hint or “stage opens at …”) so the next step is clear. So AR is not decorative; it’s the **primary way the user interacts with the quest at each location**.

**One-line summary for the panel:**  
*“We use AR because the activity is tied to real campus locations. AR anchors join, play, and rewards to the physical QR and place, so the campus becomes the game board and the experience is both physical and digital—not just a quiz in an app.”*
