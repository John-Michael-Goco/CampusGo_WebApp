# CampusGo API Documentation

Base URL for all endpoints: **`/api`** (e.g. `https://your-domain.com/api`).

**Authentication:** Most endpoints require a Bearer token. Send it in the header:
```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
Obtain the token via `POST /api/auth/signin` (or signup). Use `POST /api/auth/signout` to invalidate the current token.

---

## Convention: Document Every New API

**When you add a new API endpoint, add it to this documentation.** For each endpoint document:

- Method and path
- Whether authentication is required
- Request: body (JSON) and/or query parameters
- Response: success body (and shape) and error responses
- HTTP status codes

Keep the format consistent across the api-docs files below.
